    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",

    "## **1. Baseline: Classical Norvig Approach**\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** 70%  \n",
    "- **Speed:** Slow  \n",
    "\n",
    "The classical Norvig spell-checker relies on:\n",
    "1. **Word frequency models** to determine the most likely correction.\n",
    "2. **Simple edit-distance-based candidate generation** (inserting, deleting, replacing, or transposing letters).\n",
    "3. **Probability estimation** using word counts from a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it limited?**\n",
    "- **Context-Free:** It treats each word independently, ignoring the sentence context.\n",
    "- **Limited Correction Scope:** The edit distance approach can sometimes miss phonetically similar words or words that require multiple edits.\n",
    "- **Computationally Expensive:** Checking all possible edits and computing probabilities is slow for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. N-grams (up to 5) + Add-One Smoothing + Beam Search**\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** 73%  \n",
    "- **Speed:** 2× faster than baseline  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Changed?**\n",
    "1. **Incorporating N-grams (up to 5-grams)**  \n",
    "   - Instead of treating each word in isolation, this model considers its neighboring words.\n",
    "   - Higher-order n-grams (up to 5) allow the model to make context-aware corrections.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Add-One (Laplace) Smoothing**  \n",
    "   - Ensures that unseen word sequences get a small nonzero probability.\n",
    "   - Helps generalize better but can introduce bias, as it doesn’t distinguish between frequent and rare sequences effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Beam Search**  \n",
    "   - Instead of considering only the highest-probability word at each step, it keeps multiple candidate sequences and selects the best correction.\n",
    "   - Reduces errors in longer sentences by maintaining contextual consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it better than the baseline?**\n",
    "**Context Awareness**: The use of n-grams allows the model to understand which words are likely to appear together.  \n",
    "**Higher Accuracy (74%)**: This method captures more word relationships, improving correction quality.  \n",
    "**Faster (2× the baseline speed)**: Beam search efficiently prunes unpromising candidates, reducing unnecessary computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Why is it still limited?**\n",
    "**High-order N-grams Are Data-Hungry**: Using 4-grams or 5-grams requires a massive dataset to provide reliable probabilities.  \n",
    "**Add-One Smoothing Is Too Simple**: It doesn’t effectively model word distributions and gives equal weight to rare and frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. N-grams (Trigram) + Kneser-Ney Smoothing + Interpolation + Beam Search**\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** 79%  \n",
    "- **Speed:** 2× faster than baseline  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Changed?**\n",
    "1. **Using Trigrams Instead of Higher N-grams**  \n",
    "   - While the previous model used up to 5-grams, this approach restricts itself to **trigrams**.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Trigrams provide a balance between **context-awareness** and **data efficiency**. Using higher-order n-grams (4 or 5) introduces sparsity issues, requiring more data for reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kneser-Ney Smoothing**  \n",
    "   - Instead of just adjusting counts like Add-One smoothing, **Kneser-Ney** considers how often a word appears in different contexts.  \n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     - \"New York\" is common, so \"York\" should have a high probability when preceded by \"New\" even if \"York\" itself isn't frequent.\n",
    "     - This makes it **better at handling rare words and unseen n-grams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpolation**  \n",
    "   - Instead of relying purely on trigram probabilities, the model **blends unigram, bigram, and trigram probabilities**.\n",
    "   - Helps when the trigram is missing, falling back on bigram or unigram data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Beam Search for Sequence Correction**  \n",
    "   - Continues optimizing for best word sequence rather than choosing words in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it better than the previous approach?**\n",
    "**Context-Aware Yet Efficient**: Trigrams provide enough context without suffering from data sparsity.  \n",
    "**Better Generalization**: Kneser-Ney smoothing ensures rare and unseen word combinations are handled more effectively.  \n",
    "**Highest Accuracy (80%)**: The combination of interpolation and Kneser-Ney provides the best probability estimates.  \n",
    "**Still Fast (2× the baseline speed)**: Beam search optimizations keep speed high while improving accuracy.\n",
